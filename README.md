And how many positions does Hewlett Packard need to fill? This analysis will help future proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package. The employee data Bobby needs is only available in six CSV files because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data. But now they have finally updated their methods and decided to use SQL. My task is help Bobby build an employee database with SQL by applying my data modeling, engineering and analysis skills.
